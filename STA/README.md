__*. Static Timing Analysis (STA):__ Analyze timing paths in the synthesized netlist using Cadence Tempus tool to ensure the design meets required clock frequency specifications, checking for setup and hold violations influenced by factors like clock skew (timing differences between clock paths), uncertainty (jitter and skew margins), jitter (clock edge variations), and logic delays (propagation times through gates and interconnects). *Done.*  
   - Loaded synthesized netlist, timing libraries, and constraints into Tempus GUI; performed analysis to generate setup and hold reports, where positive slack indicates timing is met and negative slack results in violations (e.g., setup violations from late-arriving signals, hold violations from early-changing signals).  
   - Identified and fixed violations by remodifying constraints (e.g., adjusting clock periods, input/output delays, or uncertainty values) to account for skew, jitter, and delay effects.  
   - Repeated synthesis with updated constraints, then re-ran STA to verify all timing paths are met with positive slack, ensuring reliable operation at the specified clock frequency through static delay estimation of each design element without dynamic simulation.  
   - **Note**: STA is conducted at a specific operating frequency defined by the design team or system architect based on application requirements (e.g., performance, power, or throughput needs); while the client (user) demands the overall design, the frequency is decided and fixed iteratively by the designer through constraints optimization and STA validation to balance feasibility and specifications.
